How to use this asset
---------------------
Firstly, you should run the Demo scenes to get an idea of the overall functionality.
Then, please take a look at the online documentation to learn how to use all the features that Voxel Play can offer.

Documentation/API reference
---------------------------
The user manual is available online:
